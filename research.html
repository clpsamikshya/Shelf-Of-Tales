    <h3>Book Mandala</h3>
    <p>
      This is Book Mandala, the biggest Nepali online bookstore in Nepal. As of the present moment, Nepal Mandala Book Shop is the sole vendor of Books Mandala and a local bookstore, based at Lakeside, Pokhara. Since 1991, Nepal Mandala Book Shop has existed as a tiny island of peace in a fast-moving world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thriving and growing every year, the business that started from a post-card board selling postcards to tourists in the heart of Lakeside has grown to be one of the hidden jewels of Pokhara with floor-to-ceiling stacks of books and a generally inclusive vibe that makes it seem like a neighborhood spot for anyone and everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bookshop is one of the largest book distributors in Nepal. The shelves store an endless choice of books and the catalogue is always growing. You can take time browsing the seemingly endless selection of rare coffee-table books and attractive souvenir items. Taking advantage of the collection at Nepal Mandala book shop, they offer more than 25K titles for immediate delivery to most places in Nepal and worldwide — that's more titles than any other online booksellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the concept started with #bookstagramming the lofty collection at the book shop, Books Mandala has come a long way and now means different things for different people. For their team, the aim is to create the largest community of book readers in Nepal. It is about helping to foster the love of reading and supporting new authors and fellow-readers from all corners of the globe because they believe that books have the power to transform the world around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For their customers, they have tried to make Books Mandala the ultimate destination for book lovers by offering an array of book related content. With so many titles, it is vital to give customers an easy way to find precisely the books they are looking for.

    <h3>My Book Store</h3>
    <p>
      My online book store is inspired by Nepal's biggest online bookstore, "Books Mandala". This is my first web page design and I researched Books Mandala for my online book store design.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my book store, there are 5 pages: Home, Product, Contact, Blog, and Research. The Home page includes categories like Top Sales and Products For You. Top Sales showcases the best selling popular books. Products For You displays books you have recently viewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Product page offers many categories such as fiction, comedy, horror, action, etc. In my bookstore, you can add books to the cart without going to the particular book’s page, similar to Books Mandala.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some features are inspired by Books Mandala. The Contact page allows users to send feedback or problems to the bookstore. You can visit my bookstore’s Facebook page by clicking the Facebook icon. The location, email, and phone number are also provided on the Contact page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Blog page contains information about books and the importance of reading, including interesting book facts. Lastly, the Research page explains my research about my online bookstore. You can find many books in this online book store.
